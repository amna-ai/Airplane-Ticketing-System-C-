# Airplane-Ticketing-System-C++
The project is implemented using Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and file handling.
The language used is C++.

AFter downloading all the files, make a folder and place all the files in it.
The files include: Manager.txt , International.txt , Domestic.txt and the code 'OOPProject.cpp'

For the username and password for 'Manager Mode' , look into the Manager.txt.
When the first customer is added, a 'Customer.txt' file is created and you can see the username and password of the customer in it.
Everytime a new customer is added the 'Customer.txt' file is updated.

NOTE: This project needs alot of improvement, feel free to play around üòç
